# Seven Languages in Seven Weeks

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises of the book: Seven 
Languages in Seven Week by Bruce Tate.

During my journey through these seven languages I publish a blog post for each 
language on my blog. The first post provides a brief introduction and links 
to the other posts. It can be found at:
[http://blog.thesoftwarecraft.com/2013/08/back-to-noob.html](http://blog.thesoftwarecraft.com/2013/08/back-to-noob.html).

The repository is organized per language that is covered by the book. Each 
language contains my implementations of the book's most interesting exercises.
The small and trivial ones (those that you would typically do at a repl) are not 
included, and neither are any answers to any of the theoratical exercises (e.g.
looking up online resources).
